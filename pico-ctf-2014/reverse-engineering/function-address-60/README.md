# Pico CTF 2014 : Function Address

**Category:** Reverse
**Points:** 60
**Description:**

>We found this program file on some systems. But we need the address of the 'find_string' function to do anything useful! Can you find it for us?

**Hint:**
>objdump or another disassembler may be useful to you. There are only two functions in the binary that are actually created by the user, and one of them is main.
