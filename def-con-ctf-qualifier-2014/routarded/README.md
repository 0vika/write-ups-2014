## Write-up

The hint mentioned default credentials, so we tried some default credentials. After some trying, we found out the credentials were the following:

> username=
> 
> password=admin

We used this to log in on the router. Amongst other things, there was a page to ping ip's and urls. When we attempted to add another command to that, the command was sanitized, but we saw the sanitizing happening! Great, seems like a javascript-only sanitizing!

> 8.8.8.8; ls
> 
> 8.8.8.8

We disabled javascript and tried again. Now we got the directory listing!

> bower_components
> 
> flag
> 
> requirements.txt
> 
> routarded.py
> 
> static
> 
> templates

The flag seemed like the right thing:

> ; cat flag

It returned the following:

> The flag is: l0l, can't believe they still do this shit
